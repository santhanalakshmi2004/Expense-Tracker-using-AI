# Expense-Tracker-using-AI
Managing personal finances can be challenging without clear visibility into income and spending habits. This project presents a smart Expense Tracker that analyzes historical transaction data to help users monitor expenses, identify spending patterns, and predict future expenditures for better financial planning.

The system leverages data analysis, machine learning, and interactive visualizations to transform raw financial data into meaningful insights. Transactions are automatically categorized (income vs. expense), summarized over time, and used to build predictive models that forecast upcoming expenses.

By combining usability with predictive analytics, this project aims to reduce manual effort in financial tracking and support data-driven budgeting decisions.
